About The Project
The Goal of this project is to provide an efficient and scalable way to reward NFT holders to Stake & be rewarded. Provided in this repo is a Staking Contract which you can connect to a pre-existing ERC721 NFT contract and enable staking even after initial deployment. The VTC contract provides the actual token & its reward mechanisms.
